  abstract = {Mass mortalities due to disease outbreaks have recently affected major taxa in the oceans. For closely monitored groups like corals and marine mammals, reports of the frequency of epidemics and the number of new diseases have increased recently. A dramatic global increase in the severity of coral bleaching in 1997–98 is coincident with high El Niño temperatures. Such climate-mediated, physiological stresses may compromise host resistance and increase frequency of opportunistic diseases. Where documented, new diseases typically have emerged through host or range shifts of known pathogens. Both climate and human activities may have also accelerated global transport of species, bringing together pathogens and previously unexposed host populations.},

Here, we consider that the changes affect the marginal distribution of a sequence of random variables. We only consider parametric models, but the results are obtained under very general conditions. We show that the estimated configuration of changes converges to the true configuration, and we show that the rate of convergence does not depend on the dependance structure of the process: we obtain the same rate for strongly mixing and strongly dependent processes. When the number of changes is unknown, it is estimated by minimizing a penalized contrast function. Some examples of application to real data are given.},

abstract = {Traditionally, monitoring of soil, groundwater and surface water quality is coordinated by different authorities in the Netherlands. Nowadays, the European Water Framework Directive (EU, 2000) stimulates an integrated approach of the complete soil-groundwater-surface water system. Based on water quality data from several test catchments, we propose a conceptual model stating that stream water quality at different discharges is the result of different mixing ratios of groundwater from different depths. This concept is used for a regional study of the groundwater contribution to surface water contamination in the Dutch province of Noord-Brabant, using the large amount of available data from the regional monitoring networks. The results show that groundwater is a dominant source of surface water contamination. The poor chemical condition of upper and shallow groundwater leads to exceedance of the quality standards in receiving surface waters, especially during quick flow periods.}

  abstract = {There is by now a substantial literature on spatio-temporal modeling. However, to date, there exists essentially no literature which addresses the issue of process change from a certain time. In fact, if we look at change points for purely time series data, the customary form is to propose a model involving a mean or level shift. We see little attempting to capture a change in association structure. Part of the concern is how to specify flexible ways to bridge the association across the time point and still ensure that a proper joint distribution has been defined for all of the data. Introducing a spatial component evidently adds further complication. We want to allow for a change-point reflecting change in both temporal and spatial association. In this paper we propose a constructive, flexible model formulation through additive specifications. We also demonstrate how computational concerns benefit from the availability of temporal order. Finally, we illustrate with several simulated datasets to examine the capability of the model to detect different types of structural changes.},

The signal may cause a mean shift and/or a change in the covariance structure. The score statistic can capture both the spatial and temporal structures of the change and hence is particularly powerful in detecting weak signals. The score statistic is computationally efficient and statistically powerful. Our main theoretical contribution is accurate analytical approximations to the false alarm rate of the detection procedures, which can be used to calibrate the threshold analytically. Numerical experiments on simulated and real data, as well as a case study of water quality monitoring using sensor networks, demonstrate the good performance of our procedure.},

  abstract  = {We introduce a new estimator, the simultaneous multiscale change point estimator SMUCE, for the change point problem in exponential family regression. An unknown step function is estimated by minimizing the number of change points over the acceptance region of a multiscale test at a level α. The probability of overestimating the true number of change points K is controlled by the asymptotic null distribution of the multiscale test statistic. Further, we derive exponential bounds for the probability of underestimating K. By balancing these quantities, α will be chosen such that the probability of correctly estimating K is maximized. All results are even non-asymptotic for the normal case. On the basis of these bounds, we construct (asymptotically) honest confidence sets for the unknown step function and its change points. At the same time, we obtain exponential bounds for estimating the change point locations which for example yield the minimax rate 𝓞(n–1) up to a log-term. Finally, the simultaneous multiscale change point estimator achieves the optimal detection rate of vanishing signals as n → ∞, even for an unbounded number of change points. We illustrate how dynamic programming techniques can be employed for efficient computation of estimators and confidence regions. The performance of the multiscale approach proposed is illustrated by simulations and in two cutting edge applications from genetic engineering and photoemission spectroscopy.},

  abstract  = {Omnibus tests for various nonparametric hypotheses are developed using the empirical likelihood method. These include tests for symmetry about zero, changes in distribution, independence and exponentiality. The approach is to localize the empirical likelihood using a suitable 'time' variable implicit in the null hypothesis and then form an integral of the log-likelihood ratio statistic. The asymptotic null distributions of these statistics are established. In simulation studies, the proposed statistics are found to have greater power than corresponding Cramér-von Mises type statistics.},
