\section{Openings}

We saw that it is possible to extract information from data whose properties make modelling difficult. It seems that some natural future developments emerge from this work. 
The first axis of investigation regroups all works that aim to improve the modeliing of concentration data. We can push pesticids analysis forward by introducing a multivariate modeling taking simultaneous substances into account. Such methods are presented in Chapter \ref{chp:2} and introduced in \cite{pickering2016changepoint}. This broadens the scope of monitoring to substances associations. The comparison of change-points positions in different substances concentrations is possible with the works of \cite{Cleynen2014}. Observing similar change-points positions in different substances would imply a strong association in use. The evolution of the spatial distribution of anomalous clusters in time can also be another crucial point. We showed in Chapter \ref{chp:5} that the spatial distribution of Pareto levels didn't seem to be uniform. Analysing the time series of the clusters' Pareto levels could uncover additional informations.  
 
Although many models and methods improvments can be done, it doesn't tackle the issue of sampling. The second axis of work consists in building another sampling procedure. This procedure has to dampen the spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the collect of concentration data. This irregular sampling prevents from observing the dynamics of dispersion of a substance in space and time. The question of stations lcoations and sampling rythms can be seen as an optimal design problem \cite{Mueller2011,Marsh2012}. It can be noted that this could prove to be a harsh task because those methods are highly dependent on the spatial structure underlying the positions of the stations. For instance, the spatial structures uncerlying stations monitoring air or surface waters quality is drastically different. The first case allows for almost any position in a given area, the latter is more constrained: stations has to be on riverside (at least near a surface water body).
